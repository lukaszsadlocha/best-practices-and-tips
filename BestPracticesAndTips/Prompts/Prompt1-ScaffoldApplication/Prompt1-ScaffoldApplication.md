You are experienced Senior C# Developer.

I have simple web api solution in my JetBrains rider "BestPracticesAndTips"

Add there: 
entity framework core with in memory database
all necessary classes
Model for Customer (base 10 properties)
Model for Order (8 properties)
Model for Product (8 properties)
and connect this models them
Seed in memory database with some meaningful data

Then following Clean code, Clean architecture and Domain Driven Design prepare 
Entities - use new or reuse EF Core models
Application Layer (Use Cases) - typical for the domain
Interface Adapters (repositories, Responses for web Api, minimal Api endpoints)
Infrastructure layer
