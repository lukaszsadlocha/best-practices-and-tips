You are an experienced Senior C# Developer.

I have a simple web api solution in my JetBrains rider "BestPracticesAndTips"

Add there: 
entity framework core with in a memory database
all necessary classes
Model for Customer (base 10 properties)
Model for Order (8 properties)
Model for Product (8 properties)
and connect these models them
Seed in a memory database with some meaningful data

Then following Clean code, Clean architecture and Domain Driven Design prepare 
Entities - use new or reuse EF Core models
Application Layer (Use Cases) - typical for the domain
Interface Adapters (repositories, Responses for web Api, minimal Api endpoints)
Infrastructure layer
